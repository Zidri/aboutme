		 I was in the Drama club at <a href="https://whs.wsd44.org/" target="_blank">Whitefish High School</a>. I joined the drama club in my junior year, with the winter production of <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em>, where I played Violet. Our production of It's a <em>Wonderful Life</em> was a radio play based on the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/" target="_blank">movie</a> of the same name. I then worked as the stage manager for their state showcase production of <em>Everything I Need To Know, I Learned In Kindergarten</em>, which we performed in early 2019. This show was based on a <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/56955/all-i-really-need-to-know-i-learned-in-kindergarten-by-robert-fulghum/9780345466396/excerpt">book</a> of the same name. In my senior year, I was one of the main characters in the showcase production of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolves_(play)" target="_blank">The Wolves</a></em>. After the performance of <em>The Wolves</em> in early 2020, I participated in the spring production of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)" target="_blank">M*A*S*H</a></em>, where I played multiple smaller parts (due to the overlap between the preparation to perform <em>The Wolves</em> and auditions for <em>M*A*S*H</em>). In our production, I played a few background characters, as well as both Congresswoman Goldfarb and Mitzi (one of the Bonwit sisters). Though I truly enjoyed performing, my favorite part of the drama club was being able to work with all my friends to create an excellent show that we could be proud of.
